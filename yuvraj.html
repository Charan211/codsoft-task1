            Here are some moments of the famous six hitter yuvi from his career
        </h1></center>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h3>Yuvraj Singh inspires me a lot both on and off the field,He is not only a great cricketer but also a great human being,
        Battled against cancer and played cricket while suffering from the same and made a resounding comeback after recovering from the deadly cancer.
        Since his retirement from international cricket team india has never produced a middle order batsman who can replace him
        and provide the type of role he did for the team.He is now training abhishek sharma , who can potentially be the 
        replacement for yuvraj singh whon india has been searching till date,Abhi had an wonderful ipl season recently and showed some great intent 
        and aggression in this season of the indian premier league.
        </h3>
        <p1>one can learn to face any difficulties life has given to you and to accept it from the life of this great yuvraj singh paaji.</p1>
        <br>
        <p2>A wise man once said "A man will die ... but not his ideas .." these lines seem true for me when i see abhishek sharma playing... i literaly see yuvraj singh in him</p2>
